<!-- I am currently a research associate in the Department of Engineering at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) Ph.D. Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Christian Rupprecht](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.rupprecht/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). From 2018 to 2019, I was a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm).  -->

I am a research associate starting from October 2023 at the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) working with [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117). I am also closely collaborating with [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1059/1255.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interest is **controllable** and **reliable multimodal conversational AI with large language models**. Specifically, this includes **multi-modal contextual knowledge integration**, **reliability**, **hallucination reduction**, and **multimodal contextualised AI safety**. My research interest and experience also include **speaker diarisation**, **language modelling** and **speech synthesis**.



I completed my Ph.D. in June 2023. My Ph.D. at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) supervised by [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117) (advisor [Prof. Mark Gales](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/mjfg100)) on contextual knowledge integration in end-to-end neural-based conversational AI systems. I held a research internship at [Google Brain](https://research.google/) with [Dr Yu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EilVnKwAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2019 and [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) with [Dr Wei Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q8ZrKVIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in 2023. I was also grateful to have collaborated with [Poly AI](https://poly.ai/) Ltd working with [Dr Ivan Vulić](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) and [Dr. Paweł Budzianowski](https://budzianowski.github.io/) in 2023. I received by B. A and M.Eng degree in 2019 at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
