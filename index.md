<!-- I am currently a research associate in the Department of Engineering at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) Ph.D. Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Christian Rupprecht](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.rupprecht/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). From 2018 to 2019, I was a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm).  -->

I am a research associate starting from October 2023 at [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) working with [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117). My research interest is **controllable** and **reliable multimodal conversational AI with large language models**. Specifically this including **multi-modal contextual knowledge integration**, **reliability**, **hallucination reduction**, and **multimodal contextualised AI safety**. My research interest and experience also include **speaker diarisation**, **language modelling** and **speech synthesis**.
